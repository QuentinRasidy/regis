# REGIS ðŸŽ¥

REGIS : Showroom Video Manager

## Overview

REGIS is a web application which allows the video management of the Cisco FRANCE Showroom. Indeed, the Showroom has 5 cameras Panasonic 4K 360Â° configurable and controllable remotely which allows us to visualize the room in its smallest details.

With this WebApp you can create virtual demo which contains 1 or more scenes. Each scene is a fine tuning of the camera position, Webex video endpoint and
HDMI matrix. Below is the page called "Demo" where you can see the list of the demo that were created.

When you select a **demo** you are redirected to an other page where you can load all the scenes related to the selected demo. In order to load a scene from the selected demo, choose a scene and click on the button **Load**. So with REGIS you can in one click switch between scenes in order to deliver a fluid virtual demonstration.

## Equipment used

REGIS controls the following elements: 5 cameras Panasonic connected to a Room Kit Pro and a Kramer matrix (a switch video) in order to select a specific output (screen) for a given input (computer/mac).

## How to run ðŸ”¨

1. Clone this repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SarahCiscoFrance/REGIS.git
   ```

2. Change into the new repo's directory and install the Node.js dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Install mongodb and create 5 collections that you will call **"demos"**, **"saves"**, **"cameras"**, **"codec"** and **"matrix"**.

4. Then you need to add cameras info, Cisco endpoint info and HDMI matrix info. To do this add Documents in mongoDB collections : 
 
**cameras document example :** 
 
   ```sh
   {
    "ip" : "10.0.0.1",
    "description" : "CAMERA DESCRIPTION HERE",
    "name" : "CAMERA NAME HERE"
   }
   ```
   (Add one document per camera)
   
**codec document example :** 
 
   ```sh
   {
       "ip" : "10.0.0.1",
       "name" : "Cisco Webex Endpoint name's",
       "inputLabels" : [ 
           {
               "number" : 1,
               "name" : "NAME FOR INPUT WITH ID NUMBER 1 (The identifier (ID) of the connector)"
           }, 
           {
               "number" : 2,
               "name" : "NAME FOR INPUT WITH ID NUMBER 2 (The identifier (ID) of the connector)"
           }, 
           {
               "number" : 3,
               "name" : "NAME FOR INPUT WITH ID NUMBER 3 (The identifier (ID) of the connector)"
           }, 
           {
               "number" : 4,
               "name" : "NAME FOR INPUT WITH ID NUMBER 4 (The identifier (ID) of the connector)"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   
**matrix document example :**

```sh
{
    "name" : "NAME OF HDMI MATRIX HERE",
    "inputs" : [ 
        {
            "number" : "1",
            "label" : "label of input number 1 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "2",
            "label" : "label of input number 2 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "3",
            "label" : "label of input number 3 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "4",
            "label" : "label of input number 4 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "5",
            "label" : "label of input number 5 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "6",
            "label" : "label of input number 6 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "7",
            "label" : "label of input number 7 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "8",
            "label" : "label of input number 8 HERE"
        }
    ],
    "outputs" : [ 
        {
            "number" : "1",
            "label" : "label of output number 1 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "2",
            "label" : "label of output number 2 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "3",
            "label" : "label of output number 3 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "4",
            "label" : "label of output number 4 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "5",
            "label" : "label of output number 5 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "6",
            "label" : "label of output number 6 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "7",
            "label" : "label of output number 7 HERE"
        }, 
        {
            "number" : "8",
            "label" : "label of output number 8 HERE"
        }
    ]
}

```


**Warning the codec and matrix collections must contain only 1 document**

5. You need to implement the function for the kramer matrix management in the file **controllers/camera.js**.

   Create a REST API that configure the HDMI matrix and implement the function **setInOut()**, **setAllInOut()** and **getKrammerConfig()**
   in the file **controllers/camera.js** on line 798. Its functions must of course call your REST API.

6. Create a .env file in the project and add the PORT number like this:

   ```sh
   PORT=3000
   ```

7. Start the app:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
